              GovHub is a civic technology prototype built to enhance public
              participation in the legislative process. In a time when citizens
              are overwhelmed by misinformation and disconnected from how laws
              are made, GovHub offers a modern interface for following bills,
              understanding changes, and engaging in constructive discussionâ€”all
              powered by the Congress.gov API.

              <p>
                GovHub leverages the congress.gov Bill API to dynamically
                retrieve comprehensive information about any bill in U.S.
                history. Each bill page offers a wealth of data including a
                concise summary, its origin chamber, the latest legislative
                action, relevant policy areas, and its introduction date. More
                extensive information available from the API can be later
                integrated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond basic information, GovHub fosters civic discussion by
                providing a dedicated discussion section for each bill, similar
                to the familiar interface of GitHub. This feature aims to
                encourage more focused and substantive policy discussions,
                offering an alternative to the fragmented conversations often
                found on general social networks. Furthermore, legislative
                actions, amendments, sponsors, and related bills are
                meticulously tracked and updated in real-time. Users also have
                the ability to track their favorite and interesting bills.
